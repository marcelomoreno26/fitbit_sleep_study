## Analyzing the Interplay Between Sleep Patterns and Daily Physical Activity Using Wearable Data: Insights from Fitbit Trackers

This repository contains the following files:

1. **`report.pdf`**: A comprehensive report detailing the analysis of sleep patterns and daily physical activity using Fitbit data. 
2. **`code_report.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the code used for the analysis, including data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, clustering, and statistical testing.

### Environment Setup

To run the notebook, it is recommended to use **Google Colab**, as it eliminates the need to install any additional libraries. If you choose to run the notebook locally, the exact library versions used in the analysis are listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Abstract

This project investigates the relationship between sleep patterns and daily physical activity using Fitbit data from 17 users over a two-month period. The analysis leverages clustering techniques to identify distinct sleep profiles and explores correlations between sleep regularity and activity metrics. Statistical testing was conducted to determine whether sleep behaviors significantly influenced activity patterns, although results were limited by the small sample size. The findings provide valuable insights into the interplay between sleep and activity and highlight the potential of wearables for personalizing health recommendations. Future research directions include scaling the analysis to larger populations and integrating recommendation systems based on behavioral profiles.
